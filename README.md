# 5. Encrypting and Decrypting Data Using KMS
Aws kms key can be used on AWS CLI(command line interface) and in ec2 instance (for this illustration i'll be using an ec2 instance (amazon linux)) to demonstrate the encryption and decryption using AWS CMK (customer master key)

1. Encrypting a File

. Install the AWS CLI or SDK

. Ensure that the AWS CLI is installed on your EC2 instance.

. Configure the CLI with the required permissions using an IAM role that has access to KMS.

           aws configure


3. Encrypt Data Using AWS KMS with CLI
You can use the AWS CLI to encrypt a file with a KMS key. Hereâ€™s how you can encrypt a file:

bash
Copy code
aws kms encrypt \
  --key-id <KMS-Key-ID-or-ARN> \
  --plaintext fileb://path_to_your_file \
  --output text --query CiphertextBlob \
  | base64 --decode > encrypted_file
In this command:

Replace <KMS-Key-ID-or-ARN> with the ID or ARN of the KMS key.
Replace path_to_your_file with the path to the file you want to encrypt.
4. Decrypt Data Using AWS KMS with CLI
To decrypt the file, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
aws kms decrypt \
  --ciphertext-blob fileb://encrypted_file \
  --output text --query Plaintext \
  | base64 --decode > decrypted_file
This will decrypt the file and store the plain text in decrypted_file.

AWS CLI

      (aws kms encrypt --key-id <key-id> --plaintext fileb://myfile.txt --output text --query CiphertextBlob | base64 --decode > myfile.enc)

Decrypting a File

AWS CLI

aws kms decrypt --ciphertext-blob fileb://myfile.enc --output text --query Plaintext | base64 --decode > myfile-decrypted.txt

# 6. Creating an IAM Policy and Attaching It to a User

**Creating an IAM Policy**

AWS Management Console

. Go to IAM and select Policies.

. Click Create Policy.

. Choose your preffered policy editor (Visuals or json)

. Add preffered policy

. Click Review Policy.

. Give the policy a name and description.

. Click Create Policy.


**Attaching IAM Policy to a User**

AWS Management Console

. Go to IAM and select Users.

. Choose the user.

. Go to the Permissions tab and click Add Permissions.

. Choose Attach existing policies directly.

. Select the policy you created and click Next: Review.

. Click Add Permissions.

# 7. Creating a Bucket Policy for IP Restrictions

. Example S3 Bucket Policy for IP Restriction

. This policy denies access to the S3 bucket from any IP address other than 203.0.113.0/24.

json
Copy code
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket-name",
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket-name/*"
      ],
      "Condition": {
        "NotIpAddress": {
          "aws:SourceIp": "203.0.113.0/24"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

**Applying the Bucket Policy**

AWS Management Console

. Navigate to S3 and select your bucket.

. Go to the Permissions tab.

. Scroll to Bucket Policy and click Edit.

. Paste the policy JSON and click Save.

# Conclusion
You have successfully set up an S3 bucket, uploaded objects, created a KMS key with encryption capabilities, created and attached IAM policies, and applied IP restrictions to your S3 bucket.

# Best practices for cloud data security

. Data Encryption: Encrypt data both at rest and in transit to prevent unauthorized access.

. Access Control: Implement strong identity and access management (IAM) policies to ensure only authorized users can access sensitive data.

. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Require MFA for user access to critical systems to add an extra layer of security.

. Regular Auditing & Monitoring: Continuously audit and monitor cloud activity to detect and respond to suspicious behavior or security breaches.

. Data Backups: Regularly back up data to prevent data loss due to accidental deletion or ransomware attacks.

. Data Loss Prevention (DLP): Implement DLP tools to identify and prevent the transfer of sensitive information outside of authorized channels.
